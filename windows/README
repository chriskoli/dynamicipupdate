This is the code for OpenDNS Dynamic IP Updater Windows client.

The purpose of the client is to detect IP change on your network
(e.g. in case of using ISP that only provides dynamic ip) and
communicate this change to OpenDNS, so that OpenDNS can apply
filtering settings associated with a given OpenDNS account.

Gotchas when building this by yourself:
* this application makes API calls to OpenDNS website, which
  requires an API key. API key in src/ApiKey.h is not a valid
  key - you need to contact OpenDNS to obtain valid API key.
* build-installer.bat signs the installer as the final step.
  That requires a signing file which we can't make public
  (since it would allow anyone to sign an executable as OpenDNS)
  You can comment out signing step from build-installer.bat
